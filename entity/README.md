# entity
This was previously styled as a sub-directory of phileas but, since it can be used independently , has been made into a
package in its own right.

It essentially uses/abuses python's concepts of annotations and optional typing to realise 'entities'; these are long-life objects which reside in python modules under source control.

 
It contains components useful for creating invoices, quarterly accounts etc. for a small business within the Netherlands.
IT also contains some rough and ready stuff for membership administration of a club or society.

Warning: although I have used this successfully myself for some years, I have done a log of "making it up as I go along".
Also, I have removed some company-sensitive information. I intend to include example dummy information in its place, but
haven't got around to it yet!.
